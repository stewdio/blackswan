# blackswan






—add a big play button. disable spacebar as play toggle.
(or is this fun as playful discovery?)

- mouse events that use location need touch compatibility.


- add transtion CSS to #progress and #seeker so that shit is smooooooove.


- rewrite "blackswan" routine to use duration.


— maybe use audioElement.currentTime to drive the timing instead of performance.now???


—re-write riff() so can do HALF a riff (2 beats) instead of always 4 beats!
