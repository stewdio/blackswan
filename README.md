Black Swan
========================================================================
This interactive composition for **Black Swan** is a tribute to—and 
birthday present for—[Thom Yorke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke) 
and [Stanley Donwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Donwood) 
who share my birth month of October; the best month. This is also an ode
to [Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). It was 
created by myself, [Stewart Smith](https://stewartsmith.io), in 
Brooklyn, New York during the 
[COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) / 
[America’s descent into fascism](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=America%E2%80%99s+descent+into+fascism) / 
the [Anthropocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene) 
[climate crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change). 
“Fucked up”, as it were.  
  
Upon each completion of the song, a list of keyboard engagements will 
be displayed under _Receipt_. This includes both the activations 
scripted for the animation as well as your own keystrokes and pointer 
interactions. You are part of the artwork. This is your personal 
receipt for this experience. It is unique and for your eyes only.

	title="A clip of Stewart’s 2006 sketch for a “Black Swan” music video; performed via Apple’s Keyboard Viewer application." 
	width="300">  
  
I originally sketched my concept for a “Black Swan” music video in 2006 
as screen captures of live typographic performances using the 
[OS X 10.4 Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger) 
[Keyboard Viewer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-the-keyboard-viewer-on-mac-mchlp1015/mac) 
application. Keyboard Viewer, which replaced Apple’s old Key Caps 
program, highlights keys depressed by the user and displays available 
characters from the current keyboard palette. Sketches like the clip 
above were made by recording the screen while typing along to the song 
as it played back at half speed. Byproduct “receipts” of the live 
performance were created by capturing the performed typing in 
[TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit).
